# filter-condition-access

Languages: JET SQL and VBA

This code was written at an old job when I was transferred to a department that wasn't the one I was hired for. I was basically super annoyed 
with how we had to do paperwork for the conditions of all 300+ filter locations we were responsible for and decided to just write a program that 
would do the paperwork for me. This was probably the worst idea I've ever had as I got to learn while doing it that Microsoft Access removes a lot of 
SQL functionality and puts tons of weird limits on things. There was no part of this that was easy except for clicking the button at the end that saved 
me about an hour of paperwork every week. Near the end of writing it my sanity began to slip and I may or may not have had an existential crisis about 
rgb being input as bgr.
